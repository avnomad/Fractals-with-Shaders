General:

    This is a graphical application that displays the Mandelbrot and Zulia sets 
and lets you navigate through them by panning and zooming with the mouse. 
    The application allows you to select whether you want the Mandelbrot or a 
Zulia set to be displayed, the specific Zulia set to be displayed and the colors 
that will be used for rendering it. It also allows you to save the displayed 
image to a file and it 'remembers' what you were looking at the last time you 
used it.

    To render the images the application uses OpenGL and GLSL shaders to achieve 
better performance that possible when using the CPU.


Usage:

Pan/Zoom with the mouse:
Press and hold <left mouse button> and move mouse to pan. Release 
    <left mouse button> to stop panning.
Turn mouse wheel to zoom in/out. Turning it with your finger moving away from 
    you zooms in.
Press and hold <right mouse button> and move mouse to select another Zulia set. 
    Release <right mouse button> to stop changing selection.
    
All actions result in real time feedback.

Press numbers <1> through <6> to select a color set to be used for rendering the 
    fractals. (keyboard and keypad numbers should work)
Press <m> to enter 'Mandelbrot' mode. The Mandelbrot set will be rendered. (note 
    that there is only one Mandelbrot set)
Press <z> to enter 'Zulia' mode. The selected Zulia set will be rendered. (note 
    that there is exactly one Zulia set for each complex number) When in 'Zulia 
    mode a small red dot will mark the complex zero if visible.	Also a small 
    cyan-within-red dot will mark the selected complex number for which the 
    corresponding Zulia set is being rendered.
Press <enter> to save the current image being displayed to a portable pixelmap 
    file. The files will be named "image_0.ppm", "image_1.ppm" and so on until 
    the settings are deleted, in which case the numbering will restart from 0. 
    If a file with the same name as the one being saved already exists, it will 
    be deleted without warning! The files are saved in the current directory. 
    When the program finishes saving the file on disk it will alert you with a 
    'beep' sound.
Press <delete> to delete the settings file on exit instead of saving the new 
    settings. The settings are usually saved automatically on exit and include:
        * the current zoom level
        * which part of the fractal is being displayed
        * whether the Mandelbrot or a Zulia set is being displayed
        * which color table is currently in use
        * the complex number currently used to generate the Zulia set
        * the number that will be used for the next file name
    You can delete the setting file (settings.dat) manually.	
Press <escape> to exit. The settings will be saved automatically (or deleted if 
    the <delete> key was pressed earlier).

Resize window by dragging its border as usual. (window size is not saved)
Maximize/Minimize/Close application by clicking the buttons on the top-right 
    window corner as usual.
Closing any of the application's windows (terminal or graphical) closes the 
    application.
